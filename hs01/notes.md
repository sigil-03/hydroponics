two basins assembled. this involved using a 1+1/4" hole saw to cut holes in the bottom of the basins, which the ebb and flow high and low drain bulkheads were then passed through. 

## INITIAL STATE
the initial state of the system prior to logging:
1. shelving set up, with a single low shelf placed high enough to clear the 5 gallon reservoir buckets
2. lighting set up, uses a sonoff s31 running tasmota firmware + home assistant to schedule. later revisions might use a standalone mqtt controller
